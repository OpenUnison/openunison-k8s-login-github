*Short video of logging into Kubernetes and using kubectl using GitHub*

Orchestra Login Portal provides a login portal for Kubernetes that allows you to authenticate with GitHub, use GitHub teams and organizations for RBAC authorizations and provides integration for both `kubectl` and the Kubernetes Dashboard (https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard).  The portal runs inside of Kubernetes, leveraging Kubernetes for scalability, secret management and deployment. 

![Orchestra Login Portal Architecture](imgs/openunison_qs_kubernetes.png)

When a user accesses Kubernetes using Orchestra, they'll access both the login portal and the dashboard through OpenUnison (instead of directly via an ingress).  OpenUnison will inject the user's identity into each request, allowing the dashboard to act on their behalf.  The login portal has no external dependencies outside of GitHub and Kubernetes.  All objects for session state are stored as CRDs.

## What You Need To Start

Prior to deploying Orchestra you will need:

1. Kubernetes 1.10 or higher
2. The Nginx Ingress Controller deployed (https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/)
3. Client id and secret from a GitHub OAuth2 Application
4. Deploy the dashboard to your cluster 
5. helm 3.0+

When creating your GitHub OAuth2 application, the callback URL is `https://host_name/auth/github` where `host_name` is the host you want to use for your login portal.

The deployment is a four step process:

1. Add Tremolo Security's Helm repo to your own
2. Deploy the OpenUnison Operator
3. Create a secret for your Active Directory password
4. Deploy OpenUnison


## Add Tremolo Security's Helm Repo

```
helm repo add tremolo https://nexus.tremolo.io/repository/helm/
helm repo update
```

## Deploy The OpenUnison Operator

Create your namespace
```
kubectl create ns openunison
```

Deploy the operator
```
helm install openunison tremolo/openunison-operator --namespace openunison
```

Wait for the operator pod to be available
```
watch kubectl get pods -n openunison
```

## Create A Secret For Your Active Directory Password

Create a secret in the `openunison` namespace:

```
apiVersion: v1
type: Opaque
metadata:
  name: orchestra-secrets-source
  namespace: openunison
data:
  GITHUB_SECRET_ID: aW0gYSBzZWNyZXQ=
  K8S_DB_SECRET: aW0gYSBzZWNyZXQ=
  unisonKeystorePassword: aW0gYSBzZWNyZXQ=
kind: Secret
```

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| GITHUB_SECRET_ID | The secret from your GitHub OAuth2 application |
| unisonKeystorePassword | The password for OpenUnison's keystore, should NOT contain an ampersand (`&`) |
| K8S_DB_SECRET | A random string of characters used to secure the SSO process with the dashboard.  This should be long and random, with no ampersands (`&`) |


## Deploy OpenUnison

Copy `values.yaml` (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenUnison/helm-charts/master/openunison-k8s-login-github/values.yaml) and update as appropriate:

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| network.openunison_host | The host name for OpenUnison.  This is what user's will put into their browser to login to Kubernetes |
| network.dashboard_host | The host name for the dashboard.  This is what users will put into the browser to access to the dashboard. **NOTE:** `network.openunison_host` and `network.dashboard_host` Both `network.openunison_host` and `network.dashboard_host` **MUST** point to OpenUnison |
| network.api_server_host | The host name to use for the api server reverse proxy.  This is what `kubectl` will interact with to access your cluster. **NOTE:** `network.openunison_host` and `network.dashboard_host` |

| impersonation.resources.requests.memory | Memory requested by oidc proxy |
| impersonation.resources.requests.cpu | CPU requested by oidc proxy |
| impersonation.resources.limits.memory | Maximum memory allocated to oidc proxy |
| impersonation.resources.limits.cpu | Maximum CPU allocated to oidc proxy |


Additionally, you can add your identity provider's TLS base64 encoded PEM certificate to your values under `trusted_certs` for `pem_b64`.  This will allow OpenUnison to talk to your identity provider using TLS if it doesn't use a commercially signed certificate.  If you don't need a certificate to talk to your identity provider, replace the `trusted_certs` section with `trusted_certs: []`.

Finally, run the helm chart:

`helm install orchestra tremolo/openunison-k8s-login-github --namespace openunison -f /path/to/values.yaml`


## Complete SSO Integration with Kubernetes

Run `kubectl describe configmap api-server-config -n openunison` to get the SSO integration artifacts.  The output will give you both the API server flags that need to be configured on your API servers.  The certificate that needs to be trusted is in the `ou-tls-certificate` secret in the `openunison` namespace.

## First Login

To login, open your browser and go to the host you specified for `OU_HOST` in your `input.props`.  For instance if `OU_HOST` is `k8sou.tremolo.lan` then navigate to https://k8sou.tremolo.lan.  You'll be prompted for your Active Directory username and password.  Once authenticated you'll be able login to the portal and generate your `.kube/config` from the Tokens screen.

## CLI Login

You can bypass manually launching a browser with the `oulogin` kubectl plugin - https://github.com/TremoloSecurity/kubectl-login.  This plugin will launch a browser for you, authenticate you then configure your kubectl configuration without any pre-configuration on your clients. 


## Enabling JetStack OIDC Proxy for Impersonation

OpenUnison's built in reverse proxy doesn't support the SPDY protocol which kubectl, and the client-go sdk, uses for `exec`, `cp`, and `port-forward`.  If you require these options, and are using impersonation, you can now enable the JetStack OIDC proxy (https://github.com/jetstack/kube-oidc-proxy) instead of using OpenUnison's built in reverse proxy.  To enable it, add the `impersonation` options from the helm chart configuration to your chart.  **NOTE** when using the oidc-proxy `services.enable_tokenrequest` must be `false`.  The `Deployment` created for the oidc proxy will inherrit the `ServiceAccount` from OpenUnison, as well as the `services.pullSecret` and `services.node_selectors` configuration in your helm chart.  Resource requests and limits should be set specifically for the OIDC proxy under the `impersonation` section.  The proxy is run as a non-privileged unix user as well.  An example configuration when deploying with Let's Encrypt:

```
impersonation:
  use_jetstack: true
  jetstack_oidc_proxy_image: quay.io/jetstack/kube-oidc-proxy:v0.3.0
  explicit_certificate_trust: false
```

## Authorizing Access via RBAC

On first login, if you haven't authorized access to any Kubernetes roles you won't be able to do anything.  There are two approaches you can take:

### Organization / Team Driven Membership

Kubernetes will see your user's organizations and teams as groups.  To authorize users based on these groups, list them in your RBAC policies as groups with organizations being in the format `OrgName/` and teams being the format `OrgName/TeamName`.   To authorize members of team `TremnoloSecurity/Ownsers` to be cluster administrators, we create a `ClusterRoleBinding`:

```
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: github-cluster-admins
subjects:
- kind: Group
  name: TremoloSecurity/Owners
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: cluster-admin
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

### User Driven Membership

If you are not able to use teams or organizations in GitHub, you can directly add users to role bindings.  Kubernetes requires that you identify openid connect users with the prefix of the url of the identity provider.  So if your `OU_HOST` is `k8sou.tremolo.lan` and your user's login is `mmosley` your username to Kubernetes would be `https://k8sou.tremolo.lan/auth/idp/k8sIdp#mmosley`.  To create a cluster role binding to give cluster-admin access to a specific user:

```
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: github-cluster-admins
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: https://k8sou.tremolo.lan/auth/idp/k8sIdp#mmosley
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: cluster-admin
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

*NOTE*: There are multiple reasons this is a bad idea:
1.  Hard to audit - There is no easy way to say "what role bindings is `mmosley` a member of?
2.  Difficult to remove access - Same reason as #1, you need to figure out every role binding a user is a member of to remove
3.  Easy to get wrong - If you mistype a user's login id Kubernetes won't tell you

If you can't use Active Directory groups, take a look at the OpenUnison Identity Manager for Kubernetes - https://github.com/TremoloSecurity/openunison-qs-kubernetes/tree/activedirectory.  This tool adds on to the login capabilities with the ability to manage access to the cluster and namespaces, along with providing a self service way for users to request new namespaces and manage access.

# Adding Applications and Clusters for Authentication

OpenUnison can support more applications for SSO then just Kubernetes and the dashboard.  You can add other clusters and applications that support OpenID Connect by adding some custom resources to your `openunison` namespace.

## Add a Trust

The `Trust` tells your OpenID Connect enabled application it can trust authentication requests from your OpenUnison.  To start you'll need:

1. **Callback URL** - This URL is where OpenUnison redirects the user after authenticating.
2. **Client Secret** - Web applications, like GitLab, will need a secret that is shared between the two systems.  Applications with CLI components, like ArgoCD, don't need a client secret.
3. **Client ID** - This is how you identify your application to OpenUnison.

OpenUnison will provide the following claims for your application to consume:

| Claim | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| sub   | Unique identifier as supplied from authentication |
| name  | Combination of first name and last name |
| preferred_username | A username supplied from authentication |
| email | The user's email address |
| groups | The list of groups provided by the authentication source |

Once you have everything you need to get started, create the `Trust` object.  

### Create a Secret

If you're application is using a client secret, a `Secret` needs to be created to hold it.  This can either be a new `Secret` or it can be a new one.  Which ever `Secret` you add it to, keep a note of the name of the `Secret` and the key in the `data` section used to store it.

If your application doesn't have a client secret, skip this step.

### Create the `Trust`

Create a `Trust` object in the `openunison` namespace.  Here's one for GitLab you can use as an example:

```
apiVersion: openunison.tremolo.io/v1
kind: Trust
metadata:
  name: gitlab
  namespace: openunison
spec:
  accessTokenSkewMillis: 120000
  accessTokenTimeToLive: 60000
  authChainName: LoginService
  clientId: gitlab
  clientSecret:
    keyName: gitlab
    secretName: orchestra-secrets-source
  codeLastMileKeyName: lastmile-oidc
  codeTokenSkewMilis: 60000
  publicEndpoint: false
  redirectURI:
  - https://gitlab.local.tremolo.dev/users/auth/openid_connect/callback
  signedUserInfo: false
  verifyRedirect: true
```

Here are the details for each option:

| Option | Desription |
| ------ | ---------- |
| accessTokenSkewMillis | Milliseconds milliseconds added to account for clock skew |
| accessTokenTimeToLive | Time an access token should live in milliseconds |
| authChainName | The authentication chain to use for login, do not change |
| clientId | The client id shared by your application | 
| clientSecret.scretName | If using a client secret, the name of the `Secret` storing the client secret |
| clientSecret.keyName | The key in the `data` section of the `Secret` storing the client secret |
| codeLastMileKeyName | The name of the key used to encrypt the code token, do not change |
| codeTokenSkewMilis | Milliseconds to add to code token lifetime to account for clock skew |
| publicEndpoint | If `true`, a client secret is required.  If `false`, no client secret is needed |
| redirectURI | List of URLs that are authorized for callback.  If a URL is provided by your application that isn't in this list SSO will fail |
| signedUserInfo | if `true`, the userinfo endpoint will return a signed JSON Web Token.  If `false` it will return plain JSON |
| verifyRedirect | If `true`, the redirect URL provided by the client **MUST** be listed in the `redirectURI` section.  Should **ALLWAYS** be `true` if not in a development environment |

Once the `Trust` is added to the namespace, OpenUnison will pick it up automatically.  You can test by trying to login to your application.

## Add a "Badge" to Your Portal

When you login to the Orchestra portal, there are badges for your tokens and for the dashboard.  You can dynamically add a badge for your application too.  Here's an example `PortalUrl` object for ArgoCD:

```
apiVersion: openunison.tremolo.io/v1
kind: PortalUrl
metadata:
  name: argocs
  namespace: openunison
spec:
  label: ArgoCD
  org: B158BD40-0C1B-11E3-8FFD-0800200C9A66
  url: https://ArgoCD.apps.192-168-2-140.nip.io
  icon: iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAANIAAADwCAYAAAB1/Tp/AAAfQ3pUWHRSYXcgcHJvZ...
  azRules:
  - constraint: o=Tremolo
    scope: dn
```

| Option | Descriptoin |
| ------ | ----------- |
| label  | The label shown on badge in the portal |
| org    | If using orgnaizations to organize badges, the uuid of the org.  If not using organizations, leave as is |
| url    | The URL the badge should send the user to |
| icon   | A base64 encoded icon with a width of 210 pixels and a height of 240 pixels |
| azRules | Who is authorized to see this badge?  See https://portal.apps.tremolo.io/docs/tremolosecurity-docs/1.0.19/openunison/openunison-manual.html#_applications_applications for an explination of the authorization rules |

Once created, the badge will appear in the Orchestra portal!  No need to restart the containers.

## Organizing Badges

If you're adding multiple badges or clusters, you may find that the number of badges on your front page become difficult to manage.  In that case you can enable orgnaizations in OpenUnison and organize your badges using an orgnaization tree.

### Enable Organizations on your Portal Page

Edit the `orchestra` object in the `openunison` namespace (`kubectl edit openunison orchestra -n openunison`).  Look for the `non_secret_data` section and add the following:

```
- name: SHOW_PORTAL_ORGS
  value: "true"
```

Once you save, OpenUnison will restart and when you login there will now be a tree that describes your organizations.  

![Orchestra with Organizations](imgs/ou_with_orgs.png)

### Creating Organizations

Add an `Org` object to the `openunison` namespace.  Here's an example `Org`:

```
apiVersion: openunison.tremolo.io/v1
kind: Org
metadata:
  name: cluster2
  namespace: openunison
spec:
  description: "My second cluster"
  uuid: 04901973-5f4c-46d9-9e22-55e88e168776
  parent: B158BD40-0C1B-11E3-8FFD-0800200C9A66
  showInPortal: true
  showInRequestAccess: false
  showInReports: false
  azRules:
  - scope: dn
    constraint: o=Tremolo
```

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| description | What appears in the blue box describing the organization |
| uuid | A unique ID, recommend using Type 4 UUIDs |
| parent | The unique id of the parent.  `B158BD40-0C1B-11E3-8FFD-0800200C9A66` is the root organization |
| showInPortal | Should be `true` |
| showInRequestAccess | N/A |
| showInReports | N/A |
| azRules | Who is authorized to see this badge?  See https://portal.apps.tremolo.io/docs/tremolosecurity-docs/1.0.19/openunison/openunison-manual.html#_applications_applications for an explination of the authorization rules |

Once added, the new organizations will be loaded dynamiclly by OpenUnison.  Change the `org` in your `PortalUrl` object to match the `uuid` of the `Org` you want it to appear in.
